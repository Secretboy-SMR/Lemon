# Lemon
DPS parser (VERY WIP)

# Building

1. Get Visual Studio/Rider
2. Build Project

# Important
- SharpPcap may require you to install Npcap

# Disclaimers

- THIS IS VERY WIP
- THIS WILL NEED TIME TO GET UPDATED TO 2.7
- THIS WILL MOST LIKELY NOT GET UPDATED TO 2.8
- Not sure if I'm going to allow for collaborators
- I'll let it for now but I don't know if I work well with others so idk yall might hate me

# TODO
- Currently working on a general output class so I can quickly create output methods
- Also working *potentialy* on an [ACT](https://github.com/EQAditu/AdvancedCombatTracker) plugin ***maybe**
